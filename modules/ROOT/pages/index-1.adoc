= Introduction

Visibeat is a powerful application designed specifically for hotspot
policing. The system utilises interactive maps, real-time data, and
targeted patrols to help police forces proactively address high-crime
areas and improve public safety. By assigning officers to specific
geofences for designated time periods and requiring them to complete
surveys detailing their observations, Visibeat enables data-driven
decision-making and optimises resource allocation.
