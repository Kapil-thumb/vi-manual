[[patrols]]
= 10. Patrols

A patrol is an organised framework that combines geofences and officers
to ensure specific areas are monitored. Patrols can be either
operational, with scheduled days and times for certain officers to
monitor designated geofences, or default, where officers patrol assigned
geofences at any time without specific scheduling. This system allows
for efficient and flexible management of officers and area coverage.

*Operational Patrols:*

* *Definition:* Tailored patrols designed for specific operations,
involving designated officers and geofences scheduled on particular days
and times.

* *Features:* These patrols are task-specific and time-sensitive, aimed
at addressing direct actions or interventions. They operate within a
defined date range, with daily changes in officer and geofence
assignments.

* *Overrides:* Operational patrols can override default patrols,
rendering default options inactive when operational patrols are
scheduled.

* *Surveys:* Can include surveys assigned to specific geofences or the
entire patrol.

*Default Patrols:*

* *Definition:* Routine patrols integrated into daily officer
activities, involving multiple geofences and officers without
date-specific scheduling.

* *Features:* These patrols are flexible, without specific date ranges
or daily assignment variations. Officers can patrol assigned geofences
any day.

* *Surveys:* May include geofence-specific surveys but not patrol-wide
surveys.

*General Settings:*

* *Geofence Times:* Geofences may have optional time slots, specifying
when they can be patrolled. Patrols won’t activate if an officer enters
the geofence outside these times.

* *Settings Flexibility:* Global settings apply to all geofences but
specific geofences can be overridden.

* *Patrol Briefs:* Each patrol includes a description and brief, guiding
officers on their objectives during the patrol.

the system.

* image:./media/icon/2.svg[selcting officer, 16, 16] *Description*: Provide a brief overview of the patrol’s purpose and
any important details that officers should know.

* image:./media/icon/3.svg[selcting officer, 16, 16] *Default Geofence Settings*: Check this box to set the default
values for all geofences added to the patrol. It’s still possible to
override these settings in the individual geofence settings. The start
and end time parameters are used allow a geofence to be only active
during this time period. Note if an officer starts a patrol within the
time period, they will always be able to complete regardless of the end
time. i.e. the patrol will not end at the specified end time.

* image:./media/icon/4.svg[selcting officer, 16, 16] *Notifications*: Enable option if you want officers to receive a
notification when they enter or exit a geofence.

* image:./media/icon/5.svg[selcting officer, 16, 16] *Minimum Patrol Time (minutes)*: The minimum time an officer must
stay within the geofence for the patrol to be recorded in their history.
Patrols shorter than this duration will be discarded, useful for
excluding brief transits through geofences.

* image:./media/icon/6.svg[selcting officer, 16, 16] *Expected Patrol Time (minutes)*: This is the required duration that
an officer should spend in a geofence for a patrol to be considered
successful.

* image:./media/icon/7.svg[selcting officer, 16, 16] *Exit Delay (seconds)*: This setting delays the patrol's end after
an officer exits the geofence, providing a buffer to accommodate for
accidental exits or GPS inaccuracies. This allows the officer to
re-enter without prematurely ending the patrol.

* image:./media/icon/8.svg[selcting officer, 16, 16] *Survey*: Select a survey from the dropdown list that officers are
required to complete. The time when the officer can complete the survey
is configurable with the timer starting from when the patrol first
starts.
