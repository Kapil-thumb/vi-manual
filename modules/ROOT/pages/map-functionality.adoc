The search bar located at the top of the maps allows for searching on
the following keywords:

In addition to the search bar there is also the filtering options to
help users narrow down their search results based on specific criteria:

all teams involved in hotspot policing efforts. It's also possible
search and apply a filter for multiple teams.
