The Team section serves as a central location for managing the
composition and responsibilities of different police teams within your
organisation. A team, in this context, is a group of officers organised
to perform specific duties or cover designated areas within the
jurisdiction of the police force.

In this view, you can:


* *Create New Teams:* Set up new teams to address specific operational
needs or projects.

* *Assign Areas and Geofences:* Define the geographical areas each
team is responsible for, using geofences to delineate their
operational boundaries.

* *Manage Team Details:* Oversee team composition by updating the
number of assigned officers and modifying team details as required.


Each entry in the team list provides at-a-glance information, including
the total number of officers in the team, how many are currently active,
and which areas or geofences they are assigned to. Use the provided
tools to filter and search for teams, ensuring you can quickly find and
manage teams according to your operational needs.


=== Team Overview

* *Add New Team:* Click the '+ Add New' button to create a new team.

* *Search:* Search by name for a specific team. To clear a search filter over over the search bar and click “X”

* *Filters:* Use the 'Filters' dropdown to filter teams based on specific areas or on-duty status of the officers. You can refine your view to manage teams more efficiently.

* *Clear Filters:* To reset your search and see all teams, use the 'Clear' option next to the filters.

* *Total Officers:* This column shows the total number of officers assigned to each team.

* *Active Officers:* This indicates how many officers from the team are currently on duty.

* *“Assign Area”:* Assign a specific area to a team to define their area of operational patrol. Note. A team can be assigned to one  area but multiple teams can be assigned to the same area.

* *“Update Geofences”:* Configure which geofences are assigned to a
team.

===== Navigating the Geofence List

image:./media/icon/1.svg[selcting officer, 16, 16]&#160; *Search Functionality:* Use the search bar to find geofences by name
quickly. This is useful when you know the specific geofences you wish
to assign.

image:./media/icon/2.svg[selcting officer, 16, 16]&#160; *Filter Options:* Click on the filter dropdown to display geofences
by their status:

*  *All:* View all geofences.
*  *Assigned:* View geofences that are already assigned to teams.
*  *Available:* View geofences that are not yet assigned and available for you to allocate to your team.

Selection: Tick the checkboxes next to each geofence name to select or
deselect them for assignment.

===== Assigning and Saving

* After making your selections, review the total count of selected
geofences indicated at the bottom of the flyout image:./media/icon/3.svg[selcting officer, 16, 16].

* To finalise the assignment of geofences to your team, click the
'Save' button. It's essential to save to apply any changes you've
made.

===== Additional Tips

* *Inactive Geofences:* Geofences labelled as 'Inactive' are not
currently in use. Assigning inactive geofences is still possible but
be aware they will not be used during an officer patrol.

* *Bulk Selection:* You can select multiple geofences at once if
needed for the team's operations. For contiguous bulk selection of
geofences, click the first geofence in your range, hold down the
'Shift' key, and then click the last geofence; all geofences between
them will be selected.

* *Review Changes:* Before saving, double-check the selected geofences
to ensure that they align with the team's responsibilities and
operational needs.

=== Bulk Actions for Team Management

You can also perform actions on multiple teams simultaneously. This
feature streamlines processes such as sending surveys or deleting teams.

===== Selecting Teams for Bulk Actions

* To select teams, click on the checkboxes next to each team's name.

* As you select teams, notice the counter at the bottom of the screen
will update to reflect the number of teams selected.

* If you wish to select all teams, use the 'Select all' checkbox at
the bottom left corner of the list.

===== Performing Bulk Actions

* *Send Survey:* To send a survey to multiple teams, select the desired
teams and click the 'Send Survey' button located in the bottom
toolbar. You will be prompted to choose the survey that will be
distributed to the selected teams.

* *Delete:* If you need to remove one or more teams from the system,
select the teams and then click the 'Delete' button. Please use this
function with caution, as deleting a team is irreversible and will
remove all associated data from the system.

===== Additional Notes

* Only users with the appropriate permissions can send surveys and
delete teams. Refer to the roles and permissions matrix to understand
which user roles have these capabilities.

* When sending surveys, you can track responses and engagement from
the 'Surveys' and 'Responses' sections.

Use these bulk action tools to efficiently manage team-related tasks,
saving time and ensuring consistency across multiple teams.
