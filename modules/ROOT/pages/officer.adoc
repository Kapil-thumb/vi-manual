details, ranks, and assigned team.

any geofences they are assigned to.

This interface enables users to apply multiple filters to the officer
list, streamlining the process of managing and locating officer
information. +
Filters are categorised by officer attributes such as ranks,
departments, teams, and duty status. By selecting one or multiple
filters, you can create a focused list tailored to your search criteria.

'''

== Applying Filters:

To apply a filter, click on the filter category and select your criteria
from the dropdown menu or check the corresponding boxes. Your list will
automatically update to reflect your selections. You can apply multiple
filters at once for a more precise refinement.

'''

== Adjusting and Clearing Filters:

Filters can be adjusted at any time during your search. To remove a
specific filter, simply deselect it or use the 'Clear' option to remove
all filters and start anew. This flexibility allows you to seamlessly
switch between broad overviews and granular views of officer data.

== Tips
* Use multiple filters simultaneously for the most effective narrowing of officer data.
* Remember to clear filters to return to the full officer list when needed.
