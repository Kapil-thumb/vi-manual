The 4 metric widgets on the main home screen offer a quick overview of
the current state of hotspot policing efforts. These widgets display
essential data points related to active officers, active teams, and
patrols started, and surveys sent.


*Active Officers:* This displays the number of officers currently on duty
and engaged in hotspot policing activities. This metric helps
supervisors monitor the availability and deployment of their workforce
in real-time. Clicking on this widget will take you to the officer list
with the on-duty filter applied

*Active Teams:* This widget shows the number of teams currently active
with at least 1 officer on duty, participating in hotspot policing
efforts. By tracking this metric, supervisors can ensure that an
adequate number of teams are deployed to cover designated geofence areas
effectively. Clicking on this widget will take you to the team list with
the on duty filter applied

*Patrols Started:* This widget provides the total number of patrols that
have been initiated on the current day. This metric allows supervisors
to monitor the progress of daily hotspot policing activities and ensure
that officers are conducting patrols as scheduled.

Clicking on this widget will apply a filter to the activities list so
that only the “Patrol Started” events for the current day are shown:

*Surveys Sent:* This widget displays the number of surveys that have been
sent out to officers on the current day. Surveys are typically sent to
officers after they have completed their patrols, to gather detailed
information about their observations, activities, and any incidents that
occurred during the patrol. By tracking this metric, supervisors can
ensure that officers are completing their post-patrol surveys in a
timely manner, enabling the collection of valuable data for analysis and
decision-making.

Clicking on this widget will apply a filter to the activities list so
that only the “Survey Sent” events for the current day are shown:
