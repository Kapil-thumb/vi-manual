== Creating a New Survey

{blank}

image::media/media/image57.png[image,width=755,height=302,role="image-custom"]

{blank}

== Title

* Click into the 'Title' field image:media/icon/1.svg[selcting officer, 20, 20].

* This is a mandatory field. Enter a concise yet descriptive title for
the survey. The title should give a clear indication of the survey's
purpose or the operation it is associated with

== Description

* Click into the 'Description' field image:media/icon/2.svg[selcting officer, 20, 20].

* While this field is optional, providing a detailed description can be
very helpful. Describe the objective of the survey, the type of
information you are aiming to collect, or any instructions officers
might need when completing the survey.

<<<

== Automatic Data Collection

To streamline the survey process and enhance the efficiency of data
collection within the application, the 'Automatic Responses' feature has
been implemented. This function is designed to gather specific
officer-related data without the need for manual input by the officer at
the time of survey completion. The information is automatically
retrieved by the system when a survey response is submitted.

Here's how to utilise this feature:

{blank}

image::media/media/image58.png[image,width=566,height=377,role="image-custom"]

{blank}

=== In the 'Automatic Responses' section, image:media/icon/3.svg[selcting officer, 20, 20], you will see a list of data fields.

* Select the checkboxes next to each piece of information you wish to be
automatically included in the survey response. This could include the
officer's first name, last name, collar number, team, rank, department,
and specifics of the patrol like the geofence name, start and end times,
duration, and whether the patrol was successful.

* Note that these details are pulled from the system and will not appear
as questions for the officer to answer. Instead, they are silently
captured in the background for administrative and analytical purposes.

==== Add New Section image:media/icon/4.svg[selcting officer, 20, 20]

* This will allow you to create additional sections within the survey,
where you can pose questions tailored to the specific objectives of the
survey or the operation being assessed.

* When you select 'Add New Section,' a default new section is created
within the survey.

{blank}

image::media/media/image59.png[image,width=601,height=162,role="image-custom"]

{blank}

* To rename the header of this section, click on the edit box text that
is labelled image:media/icon/5.svg[selcting officer, 20, 20]. This is the section title, which you can edit to
reflect the content or focus of the questions you plan to include in
this part of the survey.

=== Add New Questions

* To begin populating the section with questions, click on the '+ Add
new question' button, indicated by image:media/icon/6.svg[selcting officer, 20, 20].

* Upon clicking, you will be presented with a list of available question
types. Choose the questions that are most appropriate for the section or
create custom questions that align with the survey's objectives.

As you continue to build your survey, each section can be tailored to
focus on different aspects of the officer's duties, experiences, or
feedback on specific operations. Ensure each question added serves a
clear purpose and contributes to the overall goal of the survey. Save
your progress frequently to avoid data loss, especially when working on
detailed sections or adding multiple questions.

== Supported Question Types

Different question types are used in surveys to match the right kind of
information being asked—like numbers for counting, yes/no for quick
checks, or maps for locations. This helps in getting clear and useful
answers easily. The following types of questions are supported:

[cols="<1,2", options="header"]
|===
|*Question Type* |*Description*

|String |Use this type for open-ended text responses where officers can
input any alphanumeric characters. +
Ideal for subjective questions or when detailed descriptions are
required.

|Integer |Choose this type for numerical responses that do not require
decimals. Suitable for quantifiable data, like the number of patrols completed.

|Boolean (Yes/No) |This type is for questions that have a binary
response: Yes or No. +
Useful for confirmations or closed questions requiring a
straightforward response.

|Decimal |Select decimal for numerical responses where fractions are
relevant. +
Appropriate for precise measurements, such as distances or times.

|Date Time |Use Date Time for responses that require a specific date and
time. +
Ideal for logging events or incidents with a timestamp.

|Single Choice |Choose Single Choice for questions where only one option
from a predefined set can be selected. +
Suitable for multiple-choice questions where only one answer is
correct.

|Multiple Choice |Use Multiple Choice for questions that allow more than
one answer to be selected from a list. +
Great for questions where all applicable options should be
considered.

|Rating |Select Rating for questions that ask for a value judgement or
assessment, typically on a scale. +
Can be used for satisfaction, performance, or agreement level
queries.

|Geolocation |Allows the officer to select a specific location from a
map. +
This is particularly useful for validating the location of an officer
during an incident or patrol.

== Branching Rules and Validations

To ensure the survey form creation process is both efficient and
logical, a set of rules and validations are in place. These guidelines
are designed to streamline the creation of surveys.

=== General Rules for Structure

* *Minimum Question Requirement:* Each section within the survey must
contain at least one question. This ensures that every part of the
survey has a purpose and gathers information.

* *Question Titles:* Every question must have a title. The title acts as
a clear prompt for the respondent, indicating what information is being
sought.

* *Branching Logic Targets:* For questions that lead to different
follow-up questions or sections based on the answer (branch actions), a
specific target for each possible answer must be set. This target could
be another question or a different section of the survey.

* *End Path Assurance:* There needs to be a clear path through the
survey questions and sections that leads respondents to the end of the
survey. This rule guarantees that every respondent can complete the
survey without getting stuck.

* *Default Next Questions:* For questions without specific branch
actions, the survey will automatically proceed to the next question.
However, this default progression can be changed to redirect to a
different question or section as needed.

=== Branching Actions and Logic

* *No Duplicate Actions:* Within the branching logic, you can't have
repeated actions. Each branch action must lead to a unique next step,
ensuring clarity in the survey’s flow.

* *Branching Restrictions:* Questions of the type 'String' (text input)
and 'Geolocation' (location selection) only allow default branching to
another question and do not allow question branching. The image below
shows the difference between these 2 types of branching options. image:media/icon/1.svg[selcting officer, 20, 20] Is
default main level branching and image:media/icon/2.svg[selcting officer, 20, 20] is the question response branching.
The image below shows how this is presented:

{blank}

image::media/media/image60.png[image,width=566,height=415,role="image-custom"]

{blank}

* *Question Order:* The order of questions with branching is important.
It's not possible to traverse back up the question chain from a branch.
If a question is part of a branch then this should come before the main
survey questions when possible.

== Creating a Branched Question Survey

Following on from the previous steps we will now create the following
Yes/No example survey:

{blank}

* image:media/icon/3.svg[selcting officer, 20, 20] Complete the question title
* image:media/icon/4.svg[selcting officer, 20, 20] Decide if the answer should be pre-selected to be “yes”
* image:media/icon/5.svg[selcting officer, 20, 20] Add the next question and choose “Number”. The add branch will be
disabled until there is at least one other question is available to be
branched to.
