[[geofences]]
= 8. Geofences

A geofence is a virtual boundary defined by points drawn on the map,
creating a geographic area that can be dynamically monitored. A geofence
is pivotal in organising and managing patrol schedules for police
officers. They serve to streamline patrols, ensuring officers cover
necessary areas and adhere to operational protocols.

Upon an officer's entry into a geofence, the system commences a timer to
track the duration of their patrol within this virtual boundary. The
success of a patrol is contingent upon fulfilling a predetermined time
requirement within the geofence.

Configuring a geofence in Visibeat is user-centric, allowing for the
customisation of various parameters including patrol duration and survey
intervals. Notifications are generated when officers enter and exit a
geofence, and officers may be prompted to complete surveys post-patrol
to gather valuable data and feedback.

Geofences are versatile in application, capable of being associated with
either teams for collective area management or with individual officers
for specific assignments. Additional customization options include
adjusting the geofence's perimeter points, and providing essential
information such as title, name, category, and description, offering a
comprehensive approach to area management and monitoring.

a prepared file.

image:./media/icon/3.svg[selcting officer, 16, 16]&#160; *Add New:* Create a single new geofence directly within the
application.
